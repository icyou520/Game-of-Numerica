**Numerica** has proved a most fascinating game to the many who have played it, for aside from its popularity as a game for two, three, four or more players, as a Solitaire, it is unequaled.

... **Directions** ...

Each player’s set consists of 52 counters of the same color, numbering from 1 to 13 inclusive, 4 of each number.

One player acts as leader, thoroughly shuffles his counters, places them face down from which he calls off the numbers as he draws the counters at random.

All other players arrange their counters in rotation and four of each denomination together, that they may be readily placed in the columns to be formed as they are called. The leader now calls the number of the counters drawn from the box, and he and the other players each place their own counters in four columns, from which four stacks are to be built of consecutive numbers from 1 to 13 inclusive.

The object is to place the counters in the columns in such a manner as to avoid “shutting in” a smaller number by a larger, for only the last number in any column can be added to the stacks. When 1 is drawn from the original quantity of counters, set it aside as a foundation of one of your four stacks.

Counters must be drawn by the leader until the required numbers for your stacks are drawn or the quantity is exhausted. For example of a “gnome,” should 10 be the first counter drawn, let it head a column; next if a larger number let it head another column, if smaller place it under the number nearest it in value, always remembering to avoid if possible, “shutting in” smaller by larger numbers. At times this will be unavoidable, but by practice you will discover the best way of disposing of your numbers. Suppose four columns to be thus far formed:


13    13    10    12
12     9    10      3
11   10      9      4
10     8      7      3
  6     6      5      2

When fortune favors you with 1—now build on your 1 by taking 2 from column 4, 3 from column 4; 4 from column 4; 5 from column 3; 6 from column 7; 7 from column 3; 8 from column 2; 9 from column 3; 10 from column 2; 11 from column 1; 12 from column 1; 13 from column 1; and you have one your stacks complete. Usually you will have two three and even four stacks building at the same time, for as soon as you draw a 1 you commence to stack.

This is simply to illustrate the best way of placing the numbers, as you will not always be so fortunate as to draw less numbers to place under greater, and so complications may arise and prevent the successful formation of your stacks.

As the drawing is simply a chance of desirable numbers for your columns or stacks, you will frequently be disappointed in undesirable ones which, however, must be accepted and placed in the best possible position, and the fortunate drawing of a coveted number will open up the columns in a most unexpected manner, and your stacks will be completed. Continue the drawing until all counters have been placed.

The added numbers on top of your stacks will give you your count for the game.

It can be played with partners, and one of the party keep tally.

Each player in turn takes the place of the leader and calls off the numbers. It is possible by the best way of placing your numbers to make 52 in one round of the game, but seldom is that number attainable many times in succession.

A moderately good player, however, can make 52 in one game out of three.

Solitaire may be played by the person taking the place of the leader, drawing from the counters (face down), and proceeding as in the regular game.
